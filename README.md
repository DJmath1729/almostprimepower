# almostprimepower
Code for the paper "The sum of a prime power and almost prime".

The Mathematica notebook computeNk_all allows one to compute all the upper bounds for \widetilde{N}. The three csv files give upper bounds for f_κ(ξ) at discrete values. Note that after downloading the files, the file path should be changed in the notebook to indicate where the csv files are stored.
